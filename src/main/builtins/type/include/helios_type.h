/**
 * The definition of a helios type struct.
 * This is the part in any helios object
 * defining what type it is. Any helios
 * struct must define a type and use it in
 * the HELIOS_OBJECT_COMMON_BASE which tells
 * the object system what type the object
 * is. It has pointers to all the functions
 * and fields acting on the type which are
 * standardized. Non standard functions can
 * still be exported (example:
 * helios_string_from_charp).
 *
 * Inheritance system:
 * Any object has an helios_type object in
 * it of which the object is an instance.
 * helios_type is always instance of itself.
 * By putting a pointer to the type of an
 * object in the first field of the struct,
 * any helios_object can be cast to the msot
 * basic object possible (helios_object),
 * and using the type it's type can be
 * determined and the object can be cast
 * back. This makes it possible to use
 * helios_object as type for any helios
 * object.
